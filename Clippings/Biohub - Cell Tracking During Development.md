## Overview

Your goal is to develop algorithms to detect, track and link cells across time in 3D microscopy data, including accurate identification of cell divisions and lineage reconstruction. You will work with real microscopy datasets to build robust methods that can handle dense cell populations, noise and complex biological structures.

Your work will eliminate a massive manual bottleneck in biological research and help scientists quantify the building blocks of life.

### Description

Tracking cells across time in 3D microscopy is a fundamental challenge in biological research. Scientists rely on time-lapse 3D imaging to study how cells grow, interact, and evolve, but analyzing this data remains a massive bottleneck. Currently, researchers spend countless hours manually tracking cells—especially in complex datasets where thousands of visually similar cells move, deform, and divide.

While automated tools exist, they often fail under real-world conditions. High cell density, imaging noise, and irregular cell shapes cause critical errors in lineage reconstruction, limiting the scalability of these studies.

This competition provides a shared benchmark to solve this problem. Your task is to detect cells, associate them across frames, and identify division events to reconstruct accurate cell lineages. By developing robust, generalizable algorithms for 3D+time cell tracking, you will help eliminate manual effort, improve scientific reproducibility, and accelerate new discoveries in developmental biology, immunology, and disease research.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using a combined tracking metric that measures both edge accuracy (how well cells are linked across time) and division detection (how well cell mitosis events are identified). The combined score is:

$\text{score} = \text{adjusted}_\text{edge}_\text{jaccard} + 0.1 \times \text{division}_\text{jaccard}$ 
$$
\text{score} = \text{adjusted_edge_jaccard} + 0.1 \times \text{division_jaccard}
$$

Edge Jaccard: Predicted nodes are matched to ground-truth nodes per timepoint via optimal bipartite assignment on scaled centroid distance (max 7.0 µm, physical scale z=1.625, y=x=0.40625 µm/voxel). A predicted edge is a true positive when both endpoints match ground-truth nodes connected by a ground-truth edge. The edge Jaccard is TP / (TP + FP + FN), adjusted by a penalty on over-predicting the total number of nodes.

Division Jaccard: A cell division is a node with two or more outgoing edges. For each ground-truth division, the predicted graph is checked for a connected component that covers the pre-split stage and touches both daughter lineages. Division TP/FP/FN are computed and combined into a micro-averaged Jaccard.

Per-sample adjusted edge Jaccards are weight-averaged by (TP + FP + FN); division Jaccards are micro-averaged across all samples.

Additional details about the metric can be found [here](https://github.com/royerlab/kaggle-cell-tracking-competition/blob/main/metrics.md). Note that cells are sparsely labeled in the ground truth, which the metric accounts for. Due to the nature of the metric, it is possible for scores to exceed 1.0.

## Submission File

Your submission CSV must contain two row types, nodes (cell detections) and edges (links between cells), grouped by dataset. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,dataset,row_type,node_id,t,z,y,x,source_id,target_id
0,44b6,node,1,0,32,128,128,-1,-1
1,44b6,node,2,1,33,130,125,-1,-1
2,6bba,edge,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,2
etc.
```
- Node rows: `row_type=node` with `node_id`, `t`, `z`, `y`, `x` (integer centroid coordinates in voxels). Set empty `source_id` and `target_id` to `-1`.
- Edge rows: `row_type=edge` with `source_id` and `target_id` referencing node IDs. Set `node_id`, `t`, `z`, `y`, `x` to `-1`.
- The `id` column is a required throwaway index (consecutive integers).
- The dataset column must match the folder names in the test set (without the `.zarr` extension).
- Every dataset in the test set must appear in the submission.
